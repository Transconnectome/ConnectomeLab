## Re-defined Model
Model1. Base model A. Y=suicide X=sociodemographic (age, sex, high_educ, marriage, site)    
Model2. Base model B. Y=suicide X=sociodemographic + KSAD   
Model3. Y=suicide X=base model A + all 25 GPS       
Model4. Y=suicide X=base model A + significant GPS  
Model5. Y=suicide X=base model A + phenotype(w/o KSAD)  
Model6. Y=suicide X=base model A + phenotype(w/o KSAD) + GPS    
Model7. Y=suicide X=base model A + phenotype(w/o KSAD) + significant GPS    
- three suicide data(ideation passive, active and attempt) for each     

## Prediction Model
1. Base model A. Y=suicide ideation. X=sociodemographic (age, sex, high_educ, marriage, site)
2. Base model A. Y=suicide attempt. X=sociodemographic
3. Base model B. Y=suicide ideation. X=sociodemographic + KSAD phenotypes
4. Base model B. Y=suicide attempt. X=sociodemographic + KSAD phenotypes
5. Y=suicide ideation_PASSIVE. X=base model A + all 25 GPS
6. Y=suicide ideation_ACTIVE. X=base model A + all 25 GPS
7. Y=suicide attempt. X=base model A + all 25 GPS
8. Y=suicide ideation_PASSIVE. X=base model A + significant GPS (GENERAL HAPPINESS_MEANINGFUL, INSOMNIA, RISK4PC, SMOKER, CP, ADHD)
9. Y=suicide ideation_ACTIVE. X=base model A + significant GPS (ADHD, ASD)
9. Y=suicide attempt. X=base model A + significant GPS (GENERAL HAPPINESS, SCZ, DEPRESSION, RISKTOL, EA)
